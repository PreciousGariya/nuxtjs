# Nuxt Signature Draw and Download Example

This Application demonstrates how to integrate signature drawing and download functionality into a Nuxt.js 3 application using the Vue Canvas Drawing library.

## Signature Draw and Download

In this Application, users can draw their signatures directly onto a canvas element. The Vue Canvas Drawing library provides a user-friendly interface for creating signatures with features like pen thickness and color selection.

Once users are satisfied with their signature, they can easily download it as an image file. The application dynamically converts the canvas content into a downloadable image, allowing users to save their signatures locally for various purposes.
